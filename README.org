* Introduction

Secrit is a simple Python library designed to interact with the 'pass' password store generated keys.

* Usage

** Retrieve a Password

To retrieve a decrypted content of a password store entry, use the `get` function:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import secrit

# You will be prompted for your master password
api_key = secrit.get("github.com/api_key")
#+END_SRC
